# A Multi-Factorial Analysis of Lemur Lifespan: Exploring the Effects of Maternal Age and Sibling Count

In this project, we will investigate the relationship between the age of a lemur’s mother when she conceives and the lemur’s lifespan. 
We will also examine whether this relationship is affected by the number of siblings the lemur has.
